# Project 1: Molecular dynamics simulation of Argon atoms

The README.md file serves as a reference for other users visiting your repository.
It should contain a brief description of your project, and document the steps others need to take to get your application up and running.
In addition, it should list the authors of the project.

How to use our code:
Open the Week2_complete.ipynb notebook and run each cell from top to bottom. Here we have written a script that can implement the Euler Method in 3D for 2 particles as intended. One can adjust the number of time steps, time step size but ot the system dimensions (Still LxLxL with L=1). The output will be at the bottom (cell with for-loop) consisting of two plots: one for the relative distances and one for the Energies (kinetic, potential and total).
